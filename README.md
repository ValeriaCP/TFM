# Predictive Model on Mental Health symptoms due to social media
This project develops a predictive model using a pre-existing database to make projections of four aspects of mental health: ADHD, anxiety, depression and self-esteem. This model is connected to a Shiny application that displays a survey where users can see their final results, once they complete the survey.
